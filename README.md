4. Users can `browse, filter or search books`.
5. `Add Book` page contains a form with basic validations.
6. `New books appear at the top of the list on the Browse page`.
7. `ScrollToTop` ensures `users start from the top of the page on every route change`.
8. Each book card has a `View Details` button leading to the `Book Details` page.
9. Floating and gradient animations are achieved with CSS keyframes.
